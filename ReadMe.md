## üó∫Ô∏è Project Overview

FlickyPlots is an innovative hackathon project that seamlessly blends AI, culture, and travel by connecting the world of cinema with real-world locations. Leveraging the power of Google Maps Platform and Gemini AI, FlickyPlots transforms a simple map into a dynamic discovery tool for movie enthusiasts and curious travelers alike.


We identify movies and their actual filming locations using Qloo's cultural data API, then plot these points on an interactive map. The real magic unfolds when you click on a location: Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro AI generates a unique, cinematic "traveler's experience," inviting you to "imagine" being right there on set.

**Designed for the Qloo hackathon** we integrate couplings of books and albums to accompany the destination.*

### Deployed Application: [FlickyPlots Enhanced Version](https://flickyplots-qloo.web.app/)

### ‚ú® Features

- Interactive Movie Map: Discover film locations plotted on a Google Map.

- -Powered Travel Experiences: Click on a location to generate a unique, imaginative narrative by Gemini 1.5 Pro, inviting you to visualize being at the filming site.

- Cultural Data Integration: Utilizes Qloo's API to source movie and location data.

- User-Friendly Interface: Designed for easy navigation and engaging exploration.

###üí° Inspiration & Problem Solved
Inspiration

My inspiration stemmed from a desire to bridge the gap between virtual entertainment and tangible exploration. I wanted to move beyond just listing filming locations and instead create an immersive experience that sparks imagination and encourages discovery. The idea of "imagining" yourself in a movie scene at its actual location felt like a powerful way to engage users with both film culture and global geography.

### Problem Solved

FlickyPlots addresses the need amongst movie goers (and travelers!)  to connect with their favorite films on a deeper level. Traditional location lists can be static and uninspiring. 

We solve this by:

  - Enhancing Discovery: Providing an interactive and engaging way to find movie filming locations worldwide.

  - Creating Immersive Experiences: Using AI to generate rich, descriptive narratives that make locations come alive, going beyond simple facts.

  - Encouraging Exploration: Inspiring users to virtually (and perhaps physically!) visit these cinematic landmarks, transforming passive viewing into active engagement.

  - What to bring - a book, soundtrack? What is the perfect pairing for your destination.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

FlickyPlots is built upon a robust stack of Google and third-party technologies:

  - Google Maps Platform: The core mapping engine for visualizing film locations.

  - Google Firebase: Our hosting platform for web application deployment and backend functions.

  - Google Gemini 1.5 Pro: Powers the AI-generated "traveler's experience" narratives.

  - Qloo API: Provides rich cultural data, specifically movie and location information.

  - Canva: Used for creating compelling imagery for the project.

  - Google Storage: For storing project imagery and assets.

  - GitHub: For version control and collaborative development.

  - Node.js 22: Runtime environment for Firebase Functions.

  - Tailwind CSS  v4 CLI: For efficient and modern styling.

###‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

#### Google Maps Platform Utilization

We extensively leveraged the Google Maps Platform to create an intuitive and informative (simple) geographic interface. 

Key aspects include:

1. Map Initialization and Customization: Setting up the interactive map with custom styling for an optimal user experience.

2. Marker Placement: Dynamically plotting film locations as markers on the map, allowing for precise geographical representation. (Popcorn anyone?!)

3. Event Handling: Implementing click listeners on markers to trigger the AI-generated content, seamlessly integrating the map with our core feature.

4. Integrations & Data Flow

    - Qloo API Integration: Our backend (Firebase Functions) makes secure calls to the Qloo API to fetch movie-related cultural data, including filming locations. This data is then processed.

     - Firebase Functions as Middleware: Serverless functions handle API requests, process data, and orchestrate interactions between the frontend, Qloo, and Gemini AI. This ensures scalability and efficient resource usage.

     - Gemini 1.5 Pro Integration: Upon a user selecting a location on the map, a request is sent to a Firebase Function, which then calls the Gemini 1.5 Pro API. Gemini, powered by the location and movie context, generates the unique "traveler's experience" narrative.

     - Frontend (React/Vanilla JS with Tailwind CSS): The user interface displays the map, markers, and the AI-generated content, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.

##  üöÄ Getting Started (for local development/testing)

To set up FlickyPlots locally:

#### Clone the Repository:

```Bash

git clone [your-github-repo-link]
cd flickyplots

```

#### Install Dependencies:

```Bash

npm install # in the root directory
cd functions
npm install
cd ..

```

#### Set up Environment Variables: 

    Create a .env file in your functions directory with your API keys (e.g., Qloo API key, Gemini API key if not handled directly by Firebase).
