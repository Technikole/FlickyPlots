# Movie Location Trends with FlickyPlots
Using Qlooâ€™s API pull cultural trend data to define movies and their locations. Plot that information to a Google Map via API call allowing curious movie goers to view movie location trends around the world. Then integrate with AI.

<!-- Train AI on MovieData? -->

Tools:
Qloo - Trend data API
Google Maps: API
Open Movie Data 
Ollama + Gemma3n or other AI
alternative: Gemini

## MVP

1. Use Qloo Trends API to Grab Movies and Locations [ authenticate QLOO, make the API call, get back movie data. ]
2. Extract Movie, Location Data from API Response (perhaps other info)
3. Plot movie location data to Google Map Points [ does this count for the hackathon? ]
4. Begin modification of idea to incorporate an AI solution


## Extended MVP [ TBD ]

3. Think genres, actors, annual trends etc
