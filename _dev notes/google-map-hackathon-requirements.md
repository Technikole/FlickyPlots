6. Judges & Criteria.
Eligible submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor (the “Judges”).

Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the sponsor. 

Stage One) The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Awards.

Stage Two) All submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

Criteria 

Functionality - How scalable is the application? How well was the Google Maps Platform used within the project at the time of release? Was the project usable Can it be used in multiple regions, or could have been used by more than one type of audience?

Purpose - Was the project solving a problem? Is it an application that would encourage a user to use it more than once for its benefits?

Content & visualization - How creative is the application? What’s the visual quality like in comparison to other applications at the time? Does the project utilize the Google Maps Platform features available at the time to effectively present information in a way that is easy to understand and insightful?

Technical execution & integrations - How well are you showcasing features of the Google Maps Platform? Does the project demonstrate quality use of the Google Maps Platform APIs?

User experience - Does the project prioritize a smooth experience, intuitive navigation, accessible features, appealing design, and impressive camera control and animation? Does it incorporate game elements that make the map experience engaging? 

The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable rewards. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Reward, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Reward.

Tie Breaking. For each Reward listed below, if two or more submissions are tied, the tied submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied submissions.

 

7. Intellectual Property Rights.
