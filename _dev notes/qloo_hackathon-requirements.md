Join the Qloo Global Hackathon —
This is your opportunity to shape the future of intelligence using Qloo’s unique insights, which combine cultural knowledge with consumer behavior to understand how people interact with the world around them.

Developers, creatives, and builders around the world are invited to a month-long event to experiment at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, and Qloo’s Taste AI™ API — the world’s most advanced graph of cultural and consumer preferences.

Qloo’s API unlocks deep, semantic insight into how people interact with the world around them — from music, TV, dining, fashion, and travel to brands, books, podcasts, and more. With no personal identifying data foundation, it’s a privacy-first way to power intelligent systems with real insight into what people enjoy and how their interests connect.

Whether you’re building a next-gen personal assistant, a smarter recommendation engine with cultural depth, or a completely new kind of app that understands people through their passions, this hackathon is your chance to push the boundaries of what’s possible with LLMs and cultural intelligence.

Why Join?
Access the world’s richest cultural intelligence platform

Power your project with Qloo’s API and your favorite LLM

Compete for cash prizes and global recognition

Build more personalized experiences, from smarter chatbots to enriched user profiles and recommendations — no personal data required

This isn’t just another hackathon — it’s your chance to build something real: a prototype that could become a product, grounded in deeper human understanding.

Team size: Up to 4 members. Solo submissions welcome.

Requirements
What to Build?
Create an original project that integrates a large language model (LLM) — such as OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, or Google’s Gemini — with Qloo’s Taste AI™ API. Your project should demonstrate how Qloo’s Taste AI™ connects behavior with cultural context, allowing for systems and businesses to make sense of people’s preferences across different domains.

Use cases may include, but are not limited to:
Cultural recommendation engines 
Taste-based personal assistants
Discovery or research tools
Smart lifestyle/travel/dining/fashion interfaces
Market-matching or audience prediction models
Personalized content or product experiences

What to Submit
Submissions to the Hackathon must meet the following requirements:

Include a Project built with the required developer tools and that meets the above Project Requirements.

Access must be provided to an Entrant’s working Project for judging and testing by providing a link to a website, functioning demo, or a test build. If Entrant’s website is private, Entrant must include login credentials in its testing instructions. The Entrant must make the Project available free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the Sponsor, Administrator and Judges until the Judging Period ends. Judges are not required to test the Project and may choose to judge based solely on the text description, images, and video provided in the Submission.

If the Project includes software that runs on proprietary or third party hardware that is not widely available to the public, including software running on devices or wearable technology other than smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers, the Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to require the Entrant to provide physical access to the Project hardware upon request.  

Language Requirements

5. Submission Modifications
Draft Submissions 

Prior to the end of the Submission Period, you may save draft versions of your submission on Devpost to your portfolio before submitting the Submission materials to the Hackathon for evaluation. Once the Submission Period has ended, you may not make any changes or alterations to your Submission, but you may continue to update the Project in your Devpost portfolio.

Modifications

After the Submission Period, the Sponsor and Devpost may permit you to modify part of your Submission after the Submission Period for the purpose of adding, removing or replacing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate. The modified Submission must remain substantively the same as the original Submission with the only modification being what the Sponsor and Devpost permits in their sole discretion. 

 

6. Judges & Criteria

Judges may be employees of the sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the Sponsor. 

Stage One) The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the Project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Hackathon.

Stage Two) All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

Intelligent & Thoughtful use of LLMs 
Does the project demonstrate thoughtful, effective use of a large language model? Are the model’s capabilities meaningfully extended or enhanced by the integration with Qloo’s API?
Integration with Qloo’s API
How well does the project incorporate Qloo’s API? Does it showcase the unique value of Qloo’s cross-domain affinities or privacy-first data approach?
Technical Implementation & Execution
Is the project well-built and smoothly operating? Does it reflect solid, industry-quality code? Are frontend and backend components thoughtfully implemented, with effective integration of tools like Qloo’s API and any LLMs?
Originality & Creativity
Is the concept novel, unexpected, or particularly insightful? Does it explore a new use case for cultural intelligence in AI or push the boundaries of what recommendation systems can do?
Potential for Real-World Application
Does the project address a real need or open up new possibilities for AI tools? Could it evolve into a useful product or be expanded into a broader use case?
*Participants acknowledge that these criteria are set by the Hackathon Sponsor and determined within the discretion of the Judges based on the submissions.

The averages of all scores recorded by the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.

Tie Breaking 

For each Prize listed below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.

 

7. Intellectual Property Rights
